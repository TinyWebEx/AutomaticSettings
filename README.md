# TinyWebEx AutomaticSettings

A simple module that allows you to specify your add-on settings in HTML-only, so you can focus on adding settings and not care about how to load and save them.

## API note

Everything in the `internal` dir is considered to be an internal module/file and thus not be considered to be an API under _semantic versioning_. That means the API there can change at any time, do _not_ import anything from there!
